Aoa, Anas, May Allah bless you with peace and mercy. I hope you are doing great! I am sharing my recent experience in the software development of a telegram chatbot that sells domain names and some more stuff.

So, I made a nodejs app with memory variables to handle data so I can switch later to MongoDB (and should be able to switch back to memory variables easily). I found these issues when I switched the code base from memory variables to MongoDB:

* üö´ nameOf["123"] = "Anas", ‚úÖ nameOf["123"] = {val: "Anas"} i.e Value of key must be an object only
* üö´ domainsSold["hello.com"] = {val: true}, ‚úÖ  domainsSold["hello@com"] = {val: true} üìùotherwise it will be considered as  { "hello": { "com":  {val: true} } } i.e The key values must not contain a dot "." otherwise it will be considered as a nested object üòÇ for example if I store in db that collection
* üö´ nameOf[123] = {val: "Anas"}, ‚úÖ nameOf["123"] = {val: "Anas"} i.e The key value of the objects should be a string so that I can edit values online in the mongo db dashboard
* Use objects instead of arrays to keep lesser code to use db
* so at the end the code for db has these methods only get, set, increment, decrement, getAll that can be used like for example get(nameOf, chatId),  get(domainsOf, chatId), increment(freeLinksUsed) etc. Nice and clean
* Consult a developer like Anas to get a good advice before starting work!
